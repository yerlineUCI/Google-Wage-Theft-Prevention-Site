      <h1> Wage Theft: Why is it important? </h1>
       <p>
         <li>Despite being against the law, employees continue to suffer minimum wage, overtime, and meal break &nbsp<br> violations amidst many other forms.</li>
<br>
         <li>Underpaid minimum wage workers lose an average of $64 per week, losing about $3,300 per year.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp</li>
<br>
         <li>Wage theft is mostly common among young workers, women, immigrant workers, and minorities who<br> have trouble standing up for themselves.</li>
           <br>
       <h1> What are we doing about it? </h1>
                <p>Our group, Under Construction, is in the process of creating a social
                 to connect employees with legal options, resources,<br> and other workers who have experienced similar situations.
                 We have also created a digital calculator to help keep track of<br> your daily income in order to compare your
                 estimated total with your actual check. Our built in alerts will notify you if<br> there is any significant difference
                 that may require you to talk to your boss/managers and any legal alternatives.</p>

         EMMANUEL<br>
         Worked for an agriculture packing industry for several weeks but was always promised a delayed check that never came. His manager and boss never returned his calls after he quit.<br>
         DASIA<br>
         Worked as a nurse assistant for 6 months until she was continously forced to work overtime without pay. Her job only hired part time and ignored any job done after the employees clock out for the day.<br>
         CHRIS<br>
         Worked for a construction company earning minimum wage without lunch breaks. He was too afraid to speak up since he was a young worker.
